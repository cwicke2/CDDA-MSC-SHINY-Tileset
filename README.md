# CDDA-MSC-SHINY-Tileset
Small mod that updates a few UDP sprites for My Sweet Cataclysm. Adds an extra bit of shine.

- gummy bears and pink gum spider are slightly transparent in places to feel more like IRL gummy candy/gum bubbles
- made necco rounder and "licorice" colored, just to introduce more colors
- marshmallow knights chocolate armor now looks like an oozing hardened chocolate shell and cleaned up the shading/texture to look softer and more generically marshmallow shaped
- gum spiders and marshmallow guys have unique death sprites (chewed up gum with legs and lump of marshmallow, respectively)
